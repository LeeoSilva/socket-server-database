# Database system:
A simple database system, written in C++ with client and server side communications via sockets.

## How does it works:
Fist an **interpreter** is called and is responsible for the input of the user
	and his meaning, then a command is sent to an **socket** responsible for
	the parsing of the informations and making sure that the final **database**
	understands and execute it flawlessly.
